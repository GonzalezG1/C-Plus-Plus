/*
 Write a program that determines which of a company's four divisions (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest)
had the greatest sales for a quarter. It should include the following two functions, which are called by main.
-double getSales() is passed the name of a division.  It asks the user for a division's quarterly sales figure, validates the input, then returns it. It should be called once for each division.
-void findHighest() is passed the four sales totals. It determines which is the largest and prints the name of the high grossing division, along with its sales figure.
*/

// set sales to 0
